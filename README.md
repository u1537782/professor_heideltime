# Professor HeidelTime

Create a multilingual corpus weakly labeled with [HeidelTime](https://github.com/HeidelTime/heideltime).

## Source Corpus

We run the weak labeling for six languages. The details of the corpus for each language are described below.

## Reconstruct the Dataset

In the `data/annotation` folder of this repository one can find the annotations produced by HeidelTime. These
annotations
are stored by language with a mapping from the document identifier to the expressions that were identified.

To attain the original corpus for Portuguese and Spanish one has to run the scrapers available on the `publico_scraper`
and `elmundo_scraper` repositories, respectively. The remaining docs can be easily downloaded by running 
`sh data/download_raw.sh`.

## Run Annotations

### Setup development environment

```shell
virtualenv venv --python=python3.8
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Install HeidelTime

For this project, we used the [py_heideltime](https://github.com/JMendes1995/py_heideltime) which requires some steps
for
the installation that is dependent on the OS. Please follow the
[installation instructions](https://github.com/JMendes1995/py_heideltime#option-2-standalone-installation) on
`py_heideltime` repo.

For Linux systems, the installation is reduced to providing HeidelTime tree tagger execution permission. This can be
accomplished with the following script.

```shell
sudo chmod 111 venv/lib/python3.8/site-packages/py_heideltime/Heideltime/TreeTaggerLinux/bin/*
```

### Download data

```shell
sh data/download_raw.sh
```

### Run the annotation

```shell
python -m src.run --data_path "data/raw/english/data.csv" --language "english" --n_files_annotate 10000 --output_path "data/annotated/english"
```
